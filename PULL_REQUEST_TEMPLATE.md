Description of the pull request. What feature have you introduced or what issue you have solved with the pull request.

If it is a solution to an issue, please include `Fixes #123` or `Closes #123` to automatically close an issue if PR is merged.

Every PR should have a testing link attached to it. Most of the time, we conduct our tests on our [test subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/memeinvestor_test). When you have done testing and your modifications do not throw exceptions when executed, attach a link to the submission where testings were held.
